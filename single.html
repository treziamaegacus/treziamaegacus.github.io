                        <p>I am student at Unversity of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP). I'm from Tagoloan Misamis Oriental.I'm 21 years old. I was born on May 1, 1998.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Life is beautiful, but not always. It has lots of problems you have to face everyday. Don't worry though! All these problems make you strong, it gives you courage to stand alone in future. Life is full of moments of joy, pleasure, success and comfort punctuated by misery, defeat, failures and problems.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There is no human being on Earth, strong, powerful, wise or rich, who has not experienced, struggle, suffering or failure. You have to work hard to reach to the highest position. Life is full of paths, you just have to choose the right one. Life is interesting and amazing like the stars up in the skies..</p>

                        <p>But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river’s face another day came when I ceased altogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this fashion. But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which the moon and the sun graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights, soft distances and over the whole sun scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily, enriching it, every passing the moment, with new marvels of coloring. The world was new to me, and I had never seen anything like this at home.

                        <p>I still keep in mind a certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when and steamboating was new to me. A broad expanse of the river was turned too blood in the middle distance the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating, black and conspicuous in one place a long calm slanting mark lay sparkling upon the water in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling rings, that were as many-tinted as an opal where the ruddy flush was faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ever so delicately traced the shore on our left was densely wooded, and the som ber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver and high above the forest wall.</p>
